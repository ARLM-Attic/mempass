# mempass

Simple UI to generate cryptographic hashes (and other things) from phrases + words. Can be used as a password manager, if the passphrase is strong enough.

This requires Kivy to run. To run from command line, type:

  kivy main.py

User-friendly packages might come out later.

## Usage

Type in a passphrase and a service-related word. Click the buttons to generate different passwords, which are automatically copied to clipboard.
